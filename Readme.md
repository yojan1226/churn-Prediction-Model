<p>In the highly competitive telecom sector, retaining customers is a top priority as customer churn significantly impacts profitability and growth. Churn prediction models use advanced machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior, usage patterns, payment history, and interaction data to identify those at risk of leaving. By proactively pinpointing at-risk customers, telecom providers can implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers, improved service quality, and timely customer engagement. These models not only reduce customer acquisition costs but also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, making them an indispensable tool for telecom companies in an era of data-driven decision-making.</p>
