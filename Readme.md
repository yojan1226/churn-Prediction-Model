🧠 Churn Prediction with Sentiment Analysis

📘 Introduction

In the highly competitive telecom sector, retaining customers is a top priority as customer churn significantly impacts profitability and growth.
Churn prediction models use advanced machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior, usage patterns, payment history, and interaction data to identify those at risk of leaving.

By proactively pinpointing at-risk customers, telecom providers can implement targeted retention strategies, such as:

- Personalized offers

- Improved service quality

- Timely customer engagement

These models not only reduce customer acquisition costs but also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, making them an indispensable tool for telecom companies in an era of data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

✅ To design and develop an approach for Churn Prediction with Sentiment Analysis on a large customer reviews dataset.

✅ To implement the proposed system with various feature extraction and selection techniques, and evaluate its performance.

✅ To validate the proposed system with respective machine learning algorithms and deploy it in a real-time environment.

✅ To explore and validate the proposed system through comparative analysis on various datasets for classification accuracy.
